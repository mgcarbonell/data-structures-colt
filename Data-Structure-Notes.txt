What do Data Structures do?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. So we can push pop sort, etc.

Why care?

The more time you spend as a dev, the more likely you'll need one of these. We can't always use arrays, some APIs or Databases will return graphs or graph representation. If you ever worked with the dom: you manipulated a tree. Ohh shiiiiiit. Lastly, interviews, they're always in interviews.

What's the best data structure? There is no best one. They each are the best for different situations. Sad face.

Map/location data, GSP application, etc.. or a code that will route you to the nearest store? Use a graph! shortest lenght, etc. 

What if we needed an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? Use a linked list! (because we're only adding to the beginning and end)

Scraping nested HTML? Binary trees, the invention of Satan.

Scheduler? Highest priority task? binary heap!

Colt's suggestion: Watch something liked Link Lists and take a break (one hour, two hours, an entire day), come back watch another section and take a brea, etc.
